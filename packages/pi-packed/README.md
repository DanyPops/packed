# pi-packed

Pi integration for `@danypops/packed`: package tools, `/packages`, `/packed`, setup apply/reload, and named profiles.

```bash
pi install npm:@danypops/pi-packed
```

The extension connects to Packed's authenticated user daemon and starts the package-local `packed serve` process when no healthy daemon is available. It contains no SQLite, registry, package execution, or daemon implementation code.
